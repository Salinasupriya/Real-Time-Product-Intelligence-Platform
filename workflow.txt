1. Get Product Data
Collect product info (name, price, image, reviews) from an online API.
Make requests fast using asyncio for multiple products at once.

2. Handle Images
Download the product image from the URL.
Open it with PIL to check size and format.

3. Analyze Reviews
Check the reviews’ sentiment using TextBlob.
Calculate average sentiment score for all reviews.

4. Create Report
Make a Word document (python-docx) for each product.
Add title, price, reviews, sentiment, and image.
Save file with a clean name.

5. Process Everything
For each product, do: 
download image → analyze reviews → create report.

Use asyncio.gather to do multiple products at the same time.

6. Test Code
Test review analysis gives correct score.
Test report is created.

Skip network tests if offline.

7. Handle Errors
If API fails or image missing, don’t crash — use fallback.
